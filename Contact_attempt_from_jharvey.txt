I'm interested in your project, I've been thinking of doing similar. Can I email you to discuss? 
I'm at mail@jaredharvey.com, I'm also on rusefi.slack.com as "kb1gtt"
I'm not on discord, and would prefer to not create another account that I'm not going to use. 

Are you still working on this dispensor? 

I'm thinking the dispenser should have the abilithy to be attached to a progressive press, 
and should have some automation features like a powder dispensed verification signal. 
As well the initial powder drop tends to bounce out of the pan and make a mess of the bench
I think the initial drop should be lower, perhaps it should get taller as it dispenses. 

If you interested, please let me know. We can discusss design considerations.
