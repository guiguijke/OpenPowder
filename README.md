## BOM
--> on progress - you can deduct if from reading the wireing diagram

## Drawings
Please open the *.png file 
++Small advice : you can use USB cable (the one you use to make a USB cable longer) to connect motor to stepper HX711 to Arduino & power.

## Code v2
I upgraded & cleaned the code in order to use PID loop to control the flow of powder and the power of the 32bit Due Board.
